            <h2>My Photography Journey</h2>
            <p>When I was growing up, I was always fascinated with nature documentries and series on tv like Life, Blue Planet, and Planet Earth. I knew very early on that I wanted to be able to travel to those remote destinations someday and see the animals I loved so much in person. My mom seemed to pick up on this, and bought me my first camera when I was 14. It was a Canon Rebel T5, and is still the camera I use to this day. My mom is one of my biggest cheeleaders for my photography, and has continually encouraged me to try new things and keep working on my skills despite having frustrating experiences and lack of training. I ended up mostly training myself, and it's been a long journey, but it's also been rewarding to see my skills manifest into me becoming the photographer I am today.</p>

            <h2>My Inspiration</h2>
            <p>Throughout my photography career, two specific people outside of my family have been huge influences and inspirations to me. Bertie Gregory is the cutest blonde British guy, and has risen through the ranks of photographers for National Geographic in recent years, earning quite a few shows of his own. The first time I ever saw one of his pictures, it was one he had captured of a costal sea wolf in the Pacific Northwest. From that moment on I decided that I wanted to be able to capture images similar to his, and be able to meet and work with him someday. Another one of my great inspirations comes from Keith Ladzinski, another prominent National Geographic photographer. Looking at some of his photos of polar bears and leopards and arctic landscapes and everything in between is truly eye opening to the beauties of the world that can be captured through a lense. I would love to be able to meet Keith or Bertie and just thank them for the joy they have brought to me and others through their photographs, and I hope to someday be able to bring that same joy to others through mine.</p>

            <h2>Why Nature Photography?</h2>
            <p>To me, nature photography just always made sense. I love hiking and fishing and just being outside in general, so it seemed like an obvious choice for me. I experimented with other types of photography for a while, I did family portraits, senior photos, even some more abstract things like documenting life in the city, the good and bad in the world. However, it really clicked in my brain that I wanted to photograph wildlife and nature after a trip to the zoo when I was 15. I got a picture of a lioness there when she stood directly in front of the glass, and you could see so much intelligence and beauty in her eyes, my little teenage self was stunned. Ever since then, I've decided that I'm going to get the perfect shot of a lion in the wild someday. I would love to be able to study and document predators in the wild in particular, and show the world that they are dangerous, yes, but most of the time, they're greatly misunderstood animals.</p>
